# Workshops of the course *Asset Management* - Evry University

This *repo* is dedicated to the 3 workshops of my course *Asset Management* for the Master *Gestion des Risques et des Actifs* at Evry University.

Before each workshop, the results will be disclosed on real data with only some R codes: only files .md will be at disposal and not source files .Rmd. 

The 4th workshop will be dedicated to R Markdown and its use to create the report for the course: see [this book chapter](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html) for more precisions on R Markdown.
